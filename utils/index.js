//questions for app//title: what is the title of your project

//description: please provide a descriotion of your project
    //Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

    // - What was your motivation?
    // - Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
    // - What problem does it solve?
    // - What did you learn?

//ToC: Do you want to add a table of contents(if your readme is too long add a table of contents)
    // - [Installation](#installation)
    // - [Usage](#usage)
    // - [Credits](#credits)
    // - [License](#license)

//Installation: What are the steps required to install your project?
    //(provide a step by step guide)

//Usage: Provide instructions and examples for use.(include screenshots as needed)

//Credits: List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
    //If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators 
    //with links to their primary web presence in this section.
    //If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

    // üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
    // Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

    // ## Features
    
    // If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
    
    // ## How to Contribute
    
    // If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
    
    // ## Tests
    
    // Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
