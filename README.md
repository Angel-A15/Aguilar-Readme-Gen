# Readme-Generator

## Project
As a developer, I want to create an application that generates a README file for me. This would decrease the time spent on creating one myself and increase my time in productivity on the codebase.

Im building the application based on these credentials:

* After being prompted for information about my application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:

  * Tests
  * Questions

* 
*

## Installation
To use the application, the user will have to copy the repository code down into their console.
Next, the user will have to change their directory to the copied repo and invoke the application by entering: index.js.
After answering the prompt questions, then the README will be generated. Finally, the user will have to open the index.html on a browser to view the final product.
