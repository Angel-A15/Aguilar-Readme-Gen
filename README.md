# Readme-Generator

## Project
As a developer, I want to create an application that generates a README file for me/others. This would decrease the time spent on creating one myself/others and increase time in productivity on the codebase.

Im building the application based on these credentials:

* A series of prompts that ask for information from the user to base the README construction
* After being prompted for information then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:
  * The title of my project and sections entitled Description
  * Table of Contents
  * Installation 
  * Usage
  * License 
  * Contributing
  * Tests
  * Questions
  
* The generated README reflects exactly what was inserted in the prompts by the user

## Description
For my application to work as intended, I decided to do the following:

* Install of NPM inquirer(package 8.2.4)
  * Enable the use of third party modules to use for project
  
* A codebase with implimication of Node.js and traditional JS:
 * Gave the ability to construct and run the application from the console

## Installation
To use the application, the user will have to copy the repository code down into their console.
Next, the user will have to change their directory to the copied repo and invoke the application by entering: index.js.
After answering the prompt questions, then the README will be generated. Finally, the user will have to open the index.html on a browser to view the final product.
